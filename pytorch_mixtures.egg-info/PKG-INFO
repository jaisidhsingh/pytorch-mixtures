## Installation

Simply using `pip3 install pytorch-mixtures` will install this package. Note that this requires `torch` and `einops` to be pre-installed as dependencies. If you would like to build this package from source, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaisidhsingh/pytorch-mixtures.git
cd pytorch-mixtures
pip3 install .
```

## Usage

`pytorch-mixtures` is designed to effortlessly integrate into your existing code for any neural network of your choice, for example

```python
from pytorch_mixtures.routing import ExpertChoiceRouter
from pytorch_mixtures.moe_layer import MoELayer

import torch
import torch.nn as nn


# define some config
BATCH_SIZE = 16
SEQ_LEN = 128
DIM = 768
NUM_EXPERTS = 8
CAPACITY_FACTOR = 1.25

# first initialize the router
router = ExpertChoiceRouter(dim=DIM, num_experts=NUM_EXPERTS)

# choose the experts you want: pytorch-mixtures just needs a list of `nn.Module` experts
# for e.g. our experts are just linear layers
experts=[nn.Linear(DIM, DIM) for _ in range(NUM_EXPERTS)]

# supply the router and experts to the MoELayer for modularity
moe = MoELayer(
    num_experts=NUM_EXPERTS, 
    router=router, 
    experts=experts, 
    capacity_factor=CAPACITY_FACTOR
)

# initialize some test input
x = torch.randn(B, N, D)

# pass through moe
moe_output = moe(x) # shape: [B, N, D]
```

You can also use this easily within your own `nn.Module` classes

```python
from pytorch_mixtures.routing import ExpertChoiceRouter
from pytorch_mixtures.moe import MoELayer
from pytorch_mixtures.utils import MHSA # multi-head self-attention layer provided for ease
import torch
import torch.nn as nn


class CustomMoEAttentionBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads, num_experts, capacity_factor, experts):
        super().__init__()
        self.attn = MHSA(dim, num_heads)
        self.router = ExpertChoiceRouter(dim, num_experts)
        self.moe = MoELayer(dim, router, experts, capacity_factor)
        
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(dim)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(dim)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.norm1(self.attn(x) + x)
        x = self.norm2(self.moe(x) + x)
        return x


experts = [nn.Linear(768, 768) for _ in range(8)]
my_block = CustomMoEAttentionBlock(
    dim=768,
    num_heads=8,
    num_experts=8,
    capacity_factor=1.25,
    experts=experts
)

# some test input
x = torch.randn(16, 128, 768)
output = my_block(x) # shape: [16, 128, 768]
```

# Testing

This package provides the user to run a simple yet reliable `absl test` for the MoE code. If all experts are initialized as the same module, the output of the `MoELayer` should be equal to the input tensor passed through any expert. Both `ExpertChoiceRouter` and `TopkRouter` are tested thusly, and succeed in the tests. The users can run these tests for themselves by running the following:

```python
from pytorch_mixtures import run_tests

run_tests()
```
Note: All tests pass correctly. If a test fails, it is likely due to an edge case in the random initializations. Try again, and it will pass.
